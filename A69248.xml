            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That which the hand is among Inſtruments, the ſame is <hi>Logick</hi> among other Arts and Sciences.
<pb facs="tcp:11467:7"/> For as the hand is a generall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that handleth all other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: So <hi>Logick</hi> is a generall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, the knowledge whereof ſerveth to handle all other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and to make a skilfull vſe of them. And as it is the propertie of Art to poliſh and perfect Nature: So it is the propertie of this Art to poliſh and direct naturall reaſon. For there is a certaine naturall <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> which man vſeth naturally, without any art; even the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſort will ſometimes make a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme vnawares. But Philoſophie, having ſearched out all the ſecrets of naturall reaſon, hath obſerued the cauſes of a good Diſcourſe, and hath ſet downe rules to that purpoſe,</p>
            <p>Wherein appeareth the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Art aboue the reſt. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that man is diſcerned from a beaſt by the vſe of reaſon: other Arts and Sciences frame man as he is a
<pb facs="tcp:11467:7"/> Citizen, or a Magiſtrate, or a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, or a Phyſician; but <hi>Logick</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth man as he is man, and maketh him after a ſort a more reaſonable creature by the right vſe of reaſon.</p>
            <p>But this Art hath chanced to fall into bad hands, that haue robbed it of her naturall ornaments, and by a ſtrange Metamorphoſis haue turned it into a faggot of dry thornes, which pricketh on every ſide; and in ſtead of drawing the rules thereof from naturall reaſon, and fitting them for the vſe of man; they haue entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled it with Metaphyſicall queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are like vnto Crabs, where there is much pickling, but little meat, and are for no vſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther civill, nor religious.</p>
            <p>This inveterate evill, which by cuſtome is turned into nature, would require a skilfuller Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and a quieter minde then mine is now, and a calmer ſeaſon then
<pb facs="tcp:11467:8"/> this wherin we are. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being caſt vpon this place by the tempeſt, as a planke of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhipwracke, and brought to a ſorrowfull reſt, I haue beſtowed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine houres vpon this Worke, and haue endevoured to giue a milder looke and countenance to this Art, plucking thoſe thornes from it, which it had gotten in the Schooles; and cloathing it with a <hi>French</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, that it might no longer walke in <hi>France</hi> like a ſtranger. For theſe many Ages paſt it hath beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taught in a moſt barbarous and thornie Latin, as if ſweetneſſe and elegancie could not ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſoliditie.</p>
            <p>If the publicke receiue any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit out of this my labour, it ſhall be wholy beholding to my Lord the Duke your Father for it. Who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received mee into his houſe, and given me a favourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
<pb facs="tcp:11467:8"/> with all kinde of reſpect and benefits, hath exhorted mee to vndertake this taske, and to teach you the Precepts thereof; wherein I haue taken a ſingular delight. For, beſides that it was a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to mee to doe you any ſervice, it hath alſo given mee the occaſion to try your wit; which I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to be endowed with a ſtrong imagination, and a ſolide iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which is not diſcouraged through difficulties: and by a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable curioſitie will not be ſatisfied but with reaſon, and where the ſame is not evident enough, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth doubts of it ſelfe. Whence it is eaſie to conceiue how great the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie of your wit will be, when time and neceſſitie ſhall giue you occaſion to make vſe of it in things of a higher and more important na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               </gap>y favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? eſpecially conſidering that you are brought vp in a familie, whence all bad examples, and all idle words are baniſhed, and where the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God is carefully maintained: and haue before your eyes the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my Lord your Father, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Princes</hi> is a notable patterne of wiſedome, of great experience, of ſingular vnderſtanding, and of wiſe governement: whoſe courage rouſeth it ſelfe againſt adverſitie, and whoſe minde is not daunted through affliction. To whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given more than others
<pb facs="tcp:11467:9"/> haue gotten by ſtudie and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, having a naturall facilitie to compaſſe that, which others by long meditation cannot attaine vnto. Whoſe words are to you as dai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and his wiſe actions as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall patterne.</p>
            <p>He it is from whom you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that Learning is a goodly ornament to a Prince. Becauſe he that guides others muſt haue the clearer ſight; and that hee muſt haue moſt knowledge, that hath moſt imployment. There being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vnbeſeeming a Prince, then, to bee inferiour to the moſt part of his Subiects in vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and good knowledge, and to owe all the preferment he hath to his birth, and nothing to his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and who to iudge aright of things, muſt ſearch into another mans braine for that which hee
<pb facs="tcp:11467:10"/> ſhould finde in his owne. This happeneth vnto ſuch Princes as haue ſpent all their younger yeares in learning how to manage horſes, rather then to governe the mindes of men, who are creatures a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more vnruly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed. Whoſe outword behaviour is taught, whileſt their ſoules are left vntaught: who imploy moneths and yeares in hunting after wilde beaſts, whileſt they themſelues are caught by domeſticall beaſts, that is to ſay, by flatterers, that intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them in vices. Who are taught to liue, as if their Subiects were made for them, whereas they are made for the good of their Subiects; and to remember that they are Princes, but not to call to minde, that they are men ſubiect to the ſame infirmities: and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received of God more graces
<pb facs="tcp:11467:10"/> then others, they haue the greater account to giue vp vnto him; and that being the image of God vpon earth, they ought to ſtriue to bee like vnto him, not onely in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, clemencie, liberalitie, and fore-ſight; but chiefly in that GOD raigneth over his Subiects, not for his owne good, but for theirs.</p>
            <p>Now when I ſpeake of Learning, I doe not meane a laborious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, busying it ſelfe about words or ſwelling Diſcourſes, or about heaping vp of much Latin. But I am of opinion that the true lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Prince conſiſteth in the knowledge of God, and of the world, and of himſelfe, and of the affaires of his owne Eſtate and of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and to be a Scholar of the dead, I meane, to ſearch in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the examples of wiſedome;
<pb facs="tcp:11467:11"/> and to learne the trade of a Prince, which is the hardeſt of all. Becauſe it is a hard matter to walke ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the top of a very high place, the braine of him eaſily turning that is very high mounted. And alſo becauſe the actions of Princes are moſt controuled, and their life moſt croſſed, and their faults moſt expoſed to view, and that they authorize vices by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Theſe inſtructions, my <hi>Lord,</hi> are familiar vnto you, and you want no domeſticall helps. Notwithſtanding I haue thought that you would not take it amiſſe, if I endevoured to contribute ſomewhat thereunto: and that by this my labour, as by a ſmall evidence, I ſhould teſtifie my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the honour which I haue receiued of my Lord your Father, and how earneſtly I pray

                  <p>To be able to form an argument, and to frame a good reaſon, we muſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11467:17"/> know, that all the Notions or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in mans vnderſtanding are, either Simple, or Compound.</p>
                  <p>Simple Notions are ſuch, as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by one word onely; As, <hi>horſe, man, whitenes, to ſee, to runne,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Compound Notions are ſuch, as are expreſſed by an Enuntiation or Propoſition, which affirmeth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth ſomething; As, <hi>Man is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. God is no lyar.</hi>

                     <hi>The ſecond Chapter.</hi> How many ſorts of ſimple Notions there are. Of Things ſingular and vniverſall. Alſo of Subſtance and Accident.</head>
                  <p>THere are as many ſimple Notions as there be things in the world.</p>
                  <p>Of Things ſome be ſingular, and ſome vniverſall.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:11467:17"/>
                  <p>Singular things are thoſe, which are one in Number; As, <hi>Frederick, Peter, this horſe, this tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vniverſall things comprehend and containe the Singulars. For an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall is a gathering together of many Singulars vnder one nature common to all. As, <hi>horſe, man, tree,</hi> vnder which words conſidered in generall, wee comprehend all horſes, men, trees.</p>
                  <p>Singulars are knowne by ſenſe, but vniverſals are comprehended by the vnderſtanding. Therfore bruit beaſts know onely Singular things. Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in Philoſophie are called <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals,</hi> becauſe they cannot be divided into two parts, keeping the ſame name. As, <hi>Alexander</hi> cannot be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two <hi>Alexanders,</hi> nor one <hi>horſe</hi> into two horſes.</p>
                  <p>A whole compounded of parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; As, <hi>water, blood, wood,</hi> are not called <hi>Individuals,</hi> becauſe they may be divided into parts, which may keepe the name of the whole. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very drop of water is water, and of a great peece of wood every parcell is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11467:18"/> wood. But if you will turne theſe things into <hi>Individuals,</hi> you muſt add the name of the meaſure. For one pint of water cannot be divided into two pintes, nor one acre of ground into two acres.</p>
                  <p>All things, whether Singular or Vniverſall, are either Subſtances, or Accidents.</p>
                  <p>A Subſtance is that which ſubſiſteth of it ſelfe; as, <hi>man, water, earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>An Accident is that which cannot ſubſiſt by it ſelfe, but muſt haue a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or ſubſtance to vphold it, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it muſt adhere; as, <hi>whitenes, ſwiftnes, wiſedome, heat.</hi> For whitenes can haue no being, if it ſubſiſteth not in ſome ſubject; as, in ſnow, or in the skinne: ſo heat is an accident to fire; ſwiftnes is an accident to an horſe; wiſedome is an accident to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Accidents are ſometimes expreſſed by a Subſtantiue; as, <hi>iuſtice, beautie;</hi> and ſometimes by an Adjectiue; as, <hi>iuſt, faire.</hi> In the firſt manner, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are called Abſtracts, or Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11467:18"/> In the ſecond, they are called Concretes, or Conjoyned. For he that names <hi>iuſtice,</hi> or <hi>beautie,</hi> conſiders ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or beautie without any certaine Subject. But he that names <hi>iuſt</hi> or <hi>

                  <p>QVantitie is that by which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are numbred, meaſured, or divided; and by which they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, or vnequall.</p>
                  <p>There be two ſorts of Quantitie.</p>
                  <p>The one is compounded of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and disjoyned parts, and therfore is called disjoyned Quantitie.</p>
                  <p>The other is compounded of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued parts, and therefore is called continued Quantitie.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:11467:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Quantitie disjoyned or ſevered is called Number, becauſe the parts haue betweene them no Continuitie. This Quantitie cannot be meaſured, but muſt be numbred.</p>
                  <p>Number is of two ſorts; either <hi>numbring,</hi> or <hi>numbred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Numbers numbring are the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Arithmetick, as, <hi>one, three, ſix,</hi> &amp;c. Numbers numbred are the things that are numbred, as, <hi>ſix men, ten hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the number numbred ſtands in ſtead of the number num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, as, <hi>Counters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vnitie is no number, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of number.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt number of all cannot be found or imagined. For a man may ſtill adde to the greateſt number that can be given.</p>
                  <p>Continued Quantitie is that whoſe parts are joyned together with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſequell, and which may be meaſured. This Quantitie is either, a Line, or a Superficies, or a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall bodie, or Time.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:11467:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>A Line is a length without breadth, as, <hi>a myle, a meating wand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Superficies is a length with breadth, as, <hi>the ſurface of the water,</hi> or <hi>of an acre of Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vnder the Superficies we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend alſo the Place, which is nothing els but the interiour Superficies of a bodie, containing another, as, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Superficies of a Hogs-head of Wine, is the place of the Wine.</p>
                  <p>A Mathematicall bodie is length, breadth, and depth; this bodie differs from a Phyſicall or naturall bodie, which is a materiall ſubſtance, and not a quantitie. Notwithſtanding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very naturall bodie hath theſe three dimenſions, and cannot be without quantitie.</p>
                  <p>Time is the meaſure of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of things. This meaſure is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the motion of the heavens, which maketh dayes and yeares.</p>
                  <p>Time hath two parts, namely, paſt, and to come: as for the preſent it is not time, but it is the inſtant or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning moment, which coupleth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11467:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> the time paſt, with the time to come.</p>
                  <p>The continuance of God is not called time, but Eternitie, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in two things. Firſt to haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning nor ending. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to paſſe away, nor to haue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of parts. For the life of God conſiſts in reſt: becauſe that if the life of God had a flux, or ſucceſſion of parts, his life were partly paſt, and partly to come.</p>
                  <p>As Vnitie is neither number nor quantitie, ſo a Prick is neither quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor part of a line: as alſo a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no part of time, but the end or extremitie of time paſt.</p>
                  <p>Number is ancienter then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued quantitie, as it appeareth by the number of the Perſons in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is eternall and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of time. But continued quantitie had a beginning with the creation of bodies.</p>
                  <p>Again, number may be counted by it ſelfe, and without any other helpe, but continued quantitie cannot be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11467:24"/> meaſured but by the helpe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued quantity. For every length or breadth is meaſured by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>There are foure ſorts of Qualities. 1.

                  <p>The preparation to a habit is called Diſpoſition, which is when a man hath not as yet gotten a habit, but is in the way to it, and hath beſides his inclination ſome little knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Naturall faculties are great helpes to get and forme a habit. For he that by nature is vnfit to any Art or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, can never attaine vnto a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whatſoever paines he takes in it. 4. Or els they are Figures and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  <p>To judge aright of any qualitie, it muſt be conſidered in the abſtract, and as not being tyed to any certaine ſubject: So <hi>iuſtice</hi> or <hi>whitenes</hi> are to be conſidered in themſelues, and not the juſt or the white.

Therfore if you will conſider a thing aright, you muſt conſider it apart and ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>One ſubſtance can haue but one quantitie, but it may haue a great number of divers qualities.</p>
                  <p>Qualities doe act, but quantities doe not, onely they doe helpe the

                  <p>A Spirit hath qualities, but no quantities.</p>
                  <p>The excellencie of qualitie aboue quantitie, conſiſts principally in that the quantitie proceeds from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the qualitie from the forme. Now the forme is ever more excellent then the matter. For by the forme things are made fit to act; but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is that which makes them apt to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Forme and Figure act not, but they helpe and facilitate the action of him that acteth, as, the <hi>roundnes</hi> of a ſtone makes it to <hi>rowle</hi> the eaſier.</p>

                     <hi>The ſeventh Chapter.</hi> Of Relation and Relatiues.</head>
                  <p>RElatiues are two things which haue a mutuall reſpect one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſo as the one cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, and the one is defined by the other, neither can the one be thought vpon without thinking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other, as, <hi>the Father</hi> and <hi>the Sonne, the Prince</hi> and <hi>the Subiects, the maſter</hi> and <hi>the ſervant, the double</hi> and <hi>the halfe, the equall</hi> and <hi>the equall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mutuall reſpect between theſe two things is called Relation. There be many Relatiues which haue the ſelfe ſame name, as, <hi>friend</hi> and <hi>friend, like</hi> and <hi>like, equall</hi> and <hi>equall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The relation between two friends is called <hi>friendſhip;</hi> the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two things alike, is called <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance</hi> or <hi>likeneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be relatiues whoſe relation is imperfect, namely, when one of the two relatiues dependeth on the other,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11467:27"/> and cannot be without it, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may well be alone, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not on his relatiue, as, <hi>the Paſtor</hi> and <hi>the flock, the Prince</hi> and <hi>the people, the ſight</hi> and <hi>the thing viſible.</hi> For there may be people without a Prince, but no Prince without people.</p>
                  <p>There be alſo relatiues, which are not relatiues in their owne nature, but only in regard of vs, and becauſe we make them ſo to be by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of them: as, <hi>the right</hi> and <hi>the left</hi> between two walls, or two trees: but if we turne our ſelues, then that which was left, is right. For in a tree there is neither right nor left by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>If a Father haue many ſonnes, there are as many ſundry relations, as there be ſonnes; becauſe the Father is taken divers times as is the center of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which is taken as often as the lines are drawne from the ſaid center to the circumference.</p>
                  <p>One and the ſame thing may haue the name of two relatiues; as, <hi>to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Sonne, to be high</hi> and <hi>low;</hi> but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11467:28"/> in divers reſpects. For the ſame may be Father to one, and Sonne to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>There be relations which ſpring from quantitie, as, the relation which is between <hi>the double</hi> and <hi>the halfe;</hi> Others that proceed from Qualitie, as, the relation between <hi>two friends.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which come from Action, as, the relation between <hi>the mother</hi> and <hi>the ſonne, the Creator</hi> and <hi>the creature.</hi> Others that ſpring from Situation, as, <hi>the right</hi> and <hi>left, the high</hi> and <hi>lowe, the formoſt,</hi> and <hi>the hindermoſt;</hi> between which Relatiues the relation hath no name.</p>
                  <p>We call that <hi>formoſt</hi> in living things, towards which the naturall motion is made; we call <hi>right</hi> that part which naturally is fitteſt for ſervice. In a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature we call that part <hi>high,</hi> by which the nouriſhment is drawne; as, in Plants, the root is the higheſt part, not in regard of the vniverſe, but in regard of the Plant.</p>
                  <p>Such relations as are grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on qualitie, admit of contrarietie, as,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11467:28"/> 
                     <hi>friendſhip, likenes:</hi> other relations ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of none.</p>
                  <p>In relations grounded vpon action, as betweene <hi>that which heateth,</hi> and <hi>that which is heated,</hi> there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie. For <hi>that which heateth,</hi> and <hi>that which cooleth</hi> are contraries; but this contrarietie proceeds from the qualitie, namely, <hi>heat,</hi> which is the ground of this relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> as it is an affection mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the lover, is a qualitie; but as it is a mutuall reſpect betweene two friends, it is a Relation.</p>
                  <p>Although God, as he is Maſter and Creator, be a relatiue to his ſervants and creatures, there is not for all that any accident in God: becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is not <hi>in</hi> the two relatiues, but <hi>between</hi> the two relatiues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it bringeth in no compoſition, nor to the ſubſtance any naturall change.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted that two relatiues are commonly called the two termes of the relation.</p>

                     <hi>The eight Chapter.</hi> Of Acting or Action.</head>
                  <p>TO Act is to moue it ſelfe againſt the patient, and to make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the power of the Agent.</p>
                  <p>Of Actions ſome be naturall, as, <hi>the panting of the heart, the motion of a ſtone downeward.</hi> Others are volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as, <hi>to buy, to ſell, to paint, to fence;</hi> which notwithſtanding are not done without the helpe of nature. Others are mixt, that is to ſay, partly naturall, partly voluntary: as, <hi>to eate, to walke, to runne;</hi> which indeed are naturall actions, but are guided by the will.</p>
                  <p>Violent actions and againſt nature, are ſuch as are contrary to naturall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11467:29"/> actions, as, <hi>the throwing of a ſtone vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> But thoſe are contrary to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary actions, which are called for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or conſtrained, as, <hi>to be pulled or haled into priſon.</hi> There be certaine actions that are partly voluntary, partly forced, as, <hi>when a Merchant ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth his merchandize into the Sea to eaſe the ſhip;</hi> or <hi>when a Patient cauſeth his arme to be cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The naturall actions and motions are ſwifteſt in the end; as, <hi>the falling of a ſtone downeward.</hi> The voluntary actions are ſwifteſt in the middeſt; as, <hi>running.</hi> The violent are ſwifteſt in the beginning; as, <hi>the caſting of a ſtone;</hi> or, <hi>ſhooting of an arrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every action importeth a certaine motion. If the motion be in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is called Generation, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. If in the Quantitie, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Augmentation or Diminution. If in the Qualitie, it is called Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If in the place, it is called Locall motion, or Tranſportation.</p>
                  <p>There is no generation without corruption, nor no corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11467:30"/> generation. But we call it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when the matter takes a better forme; and corruption, when it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into a worſer.</p>
                  <p>The locall motion is the chiefeſt of all motions, without which the reſt mooue not at all. And beſides there is no other motion belonging to the heavens; where motion is the cauſe of all other motions, as well in Subſtance, as in Quantitie, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
                  <p>The heavens in regard of the whole doe reſt, but in regard of the parts, doe change place, even as a Top that ſleepeth turning.</p>

                  <p>TO Suffer is to receiue the power of the Agent.</p>
                  <p>There are as many kinds of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as of doing.</p>
                  <p>Oftentimes the Agent doth ſuffer in acting, as, when a man rowling a weightie ſtone tireth himſelfe, and ſweateth: or when a man hurteth his teeth in cracking a Nut. The Agent doth not ſuffer, when it is out of the compaſſe of the Activitie of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as, the Sunne ſhining on the water, receiveth not the brightneſſe which the water ſend's back: becauſe it is out of the extent, which limiteth the reflection of the beames ſent back againe by the water.</p>
                  <p>God acteth alwayes, and every where, but never ſuffereth.</p>
                  <p>There are Verbs Actiues in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, which are Paſſiues in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, as, <hi>to loue, to heare, to learne:</hi> for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11467:31"/> all theſe are Paſſions, and are done by receiving. On the contrary, he which is loved or heard, is he that acteth &amp; moueth the lover and the hearer.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Paſſions perfecting, and others which are corrupting, as, <hi>the inlightning in the aire, the receiving of learning in the vnderſtanding,</hi> or <hi>of the images of things in the ſight,</hi> are Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which bring ſome perfection to the aire, to the vnderſtanding, and to the ſight.</p>
                  <p>The corrupting Paſſions are ſuch as would deſtroy the Patient, if they did continue their encreaſe, or did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe aboue meaſure, as, <hi>heating, coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, weariſomneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The perfecting Paſſions are thoſe which perfect a facultie or naturall power, and giue it that perfection for the which God did create it.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11467:31"/> or a note of ſome certaine place. For place is a quantitie, and a ſpace that may be meaſured: But the <hi>Where</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meaſured. When a man put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth a queſtion touching the Place, the demand is, by <hi>how much,</hi> as for example, <hi>how much place doth ſuch a bodie take vp?</hi> But here the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is by <hi>where</hi> or <hi>whither,</hi> as, <hi>where is the King?</hi> and, <hi>whither goe you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning Bodies the queſtion may be asked, how much place they take vp: but concerning Angels and ſoules, that queſtion cannot be asked, but onely this, where they are. This is it which the Philoſophers meane when they ſay, that Bodies are in a place <hi>Circumſcriptiuely,</hi> and Soules <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitiuely;</hi> becauſe Soules are not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or circumſcribed by place, and yet a man may ſay of them, that they are here, or there, and not els-where.</p>
                  <p>We cannot ſay that God is in a place any of theſe waies. For he is infinite, and ſo preſent in all places, as he is neither limited, nor defined by any place. It may be truely ſaid, GOD is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11467:32"/> here; but it cannot be ſaid, GOD is here, and not there.</p>

                  <p>There be two ſorts of Species. The one moſt ſpeciall, which can never be a Genus, as, <hi>man, lyon, elephant, gold:</hi> For ſuch Specieſes cannot be divided into other Specieſes: but onely into ſingular Subſtances or Individuals.</p>
                  <p>The other is a Subalternall Species,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11467:36"/> which being compared with an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Species is a Genus. As, the word, <hi>Animal,</hi> is a Species in regard of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: but a Genus in regard of man.</p>
                  <p>From the Genus and Species are drawne Arguments for Diſcourſe; and ſuch arguments are grounded vpon theſe Maximes following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whatſoever agreeth with the Genus,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That which agrees not with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, agrees not with the Species.</hi> For that which cannot be ſaid of <hi>animal,</hi> cannot be ſaid of <hi>man.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It is not neceſſary that the Species be whereſoeuer the Genus is.</hi> For if ſuch a thing be <hi>an animal,</hi> it followeth not that it muſt therefore be <hi>a man.</hi>

                  <p>Of differences ſome are greater then others. For there are things which differ onely in number; as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> There be others which differ in the Species, as, <hi>man</hi> and <hi>beaſt.</hi> There be others alſo which differ in the Genus, as, <hi>a man</hi> and <hi>a ſtone.</hi> But the greateſt differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is, when two things are in two divers Categories, as, <hi>a horſe</hi> and <hi>whitenes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be alſo eſſentiall differences, and accidentall differences. As, a man differeth from a horſe in eſſence, and definition. But a French man differs from a Moore onely in colour and complexion, which are accidents, and not things which make man to be man.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:11467:37"/>
                  <p>Among the eſſentiall differences, the principall and moſt conſiderable is that, which is called Superficiall, by which the Specieſes of the ſame Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus differ eſſentially. This difference hath theſe two properties. That it conſtitutes the Specieſes; And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Genuſes. Thus the <hi>life ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue,</hi> is the difference which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes <hi>the animal,</hi> and maketh the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal to be Animal. The ſelfe ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference divideth the Genus; namely, <hi>Living.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>to be reaſonable,</hi> is the difference which divideth <hi>animal,</hi> and conſtitutes man. And the ſame perfection which maketh man to be man, is that which maketh him differ from other Animals.</p>

                  <p>There be two ſorts of Whole: the one which may be divided into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall parts; the other into materiall parts.</p>
                  <p>The Formall parts are thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Definition is compounded. As, the Genus and the Difference are the parts of a Definition. So <hi>animal</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> be the two formall parts of a man. So the formall parts of a houſe, or of an image of ſtone, are <hi>their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and their externall formes or figures.</hi> Such parts may eaſily be diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed by our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but cannot be really ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>The Materiall parts are thoſe which differ in Situation, and which for the moſt part may really be ſeparated. As the materiall parts of the world are <hi>the heavens</hi> and <hi>the foure Elements:</hi> the materiall parts of a houſe are <hi>the foundation, the walles,</hi> and <hi>the roofe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every materiall part hath a ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by it ſelfe, except there be a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling or commixtion of the ſaid parts. As when <hi>wine is mingled with water,</hi> or when <hi>the foure Elements are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11467:40"/> in a Bodie.</hi> Materiall parts are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alike among themſelues (As, <hi>the parts of water, Bloud, Butter, Oile:</hi>) or els are vnlike, as, <hi>the parts of a mans bodie,</hi> or <hi>of a houſe.</hi> The parts alike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues haue no certaine number; becauſe they may be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely divided.</p>
                  <p>The parts vnlike are either Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grals, or not Integrals.</p>
                  <p>The Integrall parts are thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the whole is immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. As, <hi>a Kingdome</hi> is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately compounded <hi>of a King</hi> &amp; the <hi>three eſtates. The world</hi> is compounded of <hi>the heavens</hi> and <hi>the foure Elements. An animal</hi> is compounded of <hi>a bodie</hi> and <hi>a ſoule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But vnder one of theſe parts are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes contained other little parts which are not Integrals: that is to ſay, whereof the Whole or the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire is not immediately compounded. Among which there are ſome that are not neceſſary, ſerving rather for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conveniencie, then for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie. As, in a Common-wealth,

                  <p>DEfinition is a ſpeech which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the eſſence of the thing. The perfect definition of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is that, which is compounded of the next Genus and the ſpecificall difference. As, the definition of <hi>a Plant</hi> is, to be <hi>a bodie liuing a vegetatiue life: of man,</hi> to be <hi>a reaſonable creature.</hi> There are but few ſuch Definitions; becauſe the formes and eſſentiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of ſubſtances are not ſo well knowne vnto vs. God onely who
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:11467:42"/> made them, doth exactly know them.</p>
                  <p>The perfect definition of an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is compounded of three parts, namely, of the next Genus, of the proper Subject, and of the next Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or Finall cauſe. As for example, <hi>death</hi> is an accident, whereof the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus is, <hi>the end</hi> or <hi>deſtruction of life,</hi> the Subject is, <hi>a liuing bodie,</hi> and the next Efficient cauſe is, <hi>the extinguiſhing of vitall heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore is the perfect defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>death,</hi> namely, that it is <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the life of a liuing bodie by extinguiſhing the vitall heat.</hi> Thus are defined anger, griefe, ſicknes, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, earthquake, the Eclipſe of the Moone, and that of the Sunne, Civil-warre, reſpiration, and divers other things, whereof wee ſhall produce ſome examples in the end of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now but Proper Accidents can be thus defined. For mutable and caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Accidents, or ſuch as haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowne cauſe, or that depend vpon the will of man, cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11467:43"/> defined. And therefore in ſtead of a Definition, we deſcribe them, as well as we may, expreſſing their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and ſome certaine propertie. So <hi>whitenes</hi> is defined, when we ſay, that it is <hi>a moſt ſimple and moſt cleare colour.</hi> And <hi>light</hi> is defined to be <hi>the chiefe of all whiteneſſes;</hi> or, <hi>the whitenes of the bodie of the Sunne ſending forth his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes through tranſparent bodies.</hi>

                     <hi>The eleventh Chapter.</hi> Of Cauſes and Effects.</head>
                  <p>A Cauſe is that which bringeth forth an Effect: or that by which or for which any thing is.</p>
                  <p>There be foure kinds of Cauſes: the Materiall, the Formall, the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and the Finall. For example, <hi>the matter</hi> of a houſe is ſtones, wood, and tyles: <hi>the forme</hi> is the ſtructure and manner of building, which ariſeth from the placing or ordering of the parts: <hi>the efficient cauſe</hi> is the Maſter-builder: <hi>the finall cauſe</hi> is for dwelling or habitation.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:11467:47"/>
                  <p>The efficient and finall cauſes are called <hi>Externall,</hi> becauſe they are out of the thing, and are not parts of it. As the builder is no part of the houſe: for ſuppoſe the builder were ſhut vp in the houſe, which he hath built, yet were he ſtill an externall cauſe, by reaſon that he is not of the eſſence or definition of the houſe, nor any part of it. But the matter and forme are <hi>Internal</hi> cauſes, becauſe the thing is compoſed of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The cauſe Materiall.</note>Matter is that whereof the thing is compoſed. As, <hi>leather</hi> is the matter of a ſhoe, becauſe a ſhoe is made of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Matter is of two ſorts: the one is called matter of Generation, as, <hi>the ſeed</hi> is the matter of the Generation of a tree; <hi>ſlime</hi> is the matter of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of frogs; ſo <hi>water</hi> is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ice. The other is the matter of Compoſition. As, <hi>the foure elements</hi> are the matter wherof a bodie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; <hi>wood and ſtone</hi> are the matter of a houſe.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes matter is taken impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11467:47"/> for the ſubject whereof we ſpeake or write. Thus <hi>battails</hi> and <hi>loue</hi> are the matter of the booke of <hi>Arioſt.</hi> And ſometimes for the occaſion and ſubject whereabout man doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and occupie himſelfe. As, <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> are the matter of an Arithmetici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>troubles</hi> are the matter of proweſſe and patience.</p>
                  <p>Forme is that which giueth being to a thing.<note place="margin">Formall.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of Formes ſome are Naturall. As the forme of an Animal is <hi>the ſenſitiue ſoule:</hi> and the forme of the eye is <hi>the facultie of ſeeing:</hi> Others are Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. As the forme of a ſtatua, of a houſe, or of a clock.</p>
                  <p>Naturall formes are part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and are multiplied by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Artificiall formes are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and no parts of the ſubſtance, neither are they multiplied by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or propagation. If we engraue the image of <hi>Caeſar</hi> vpon a nut, that nut being planted will bring forth fruit and nuts, but not the image of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And thence it is that children

                  <p>The Efficient<note place="margin">Efficient.</note> cauſe is that by which a thing is. As <hi>the Sunne</hi> is the efficient cauſe of the day: and <hi>the fire</hi> of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and <hi>ſicknes</hi> of death: and <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the Moone,</hi> the cauſe of the eclipſe of the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>Vnder the Efficient cauſe we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the cauſe which is called Meritorious. As <hi>murther</hi> is the cauſe of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe vnder the Efficient cauſe we comprehend the cauſe which is called Defectiue. As <hi>the want of ſight</hi> is the cauſe of going aſtray; and <hi>the abſence of the Sunne,</hi> is the cauſe of night, howſoever by nature it be the cauſe of day.</p>
                  <p>All inſtruments, both naturall, as, <hi>the eye</hi> and <hi>the hand;</hi> and artificiall, as, <hi>an Axe</hi> and <hi>a ſword,</hi> are in ſome ſort Efficient cauſes. For though they act not by their owne proper power, yet they helpe the action; and without them the naturall action would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be weake or altogether hindered.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:11467:48"/>
                  <p>The Finall<note place="margin">Finall.</note> cauſe is that for the which a thing is done. So the end of Phyſick is <hi>to heale the ſick,</hi> and the end of Studie is <hi>to get learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt warily diſtinguiſh <hi>the ſcope</hi> from <hi>the end.</hi> As, the ſcope of walking is <hi>health,</hi> but the end is the <hi>laſt ſtep;</hi> the one is the end of the intention; the other the end of progreſſion.</p>
                  <p>The finall cauſe may alſo be the formall and efficient cauſe, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reſpects. As, the forme of the houſe is the end of the builder: and the forme of a horſe engendred is the efficient cauſe of the operations of the ſame horſe, and alſo the finall cauſe of the horſe engendring. And that which is the final cauſe, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Of cauſes the finall is the beſt, and moſt excellent: becauſe all the other tend vnto it, and ſerue it.</p>
                  <p>The finall cauſe as it is the laſt in execution, ſo it is the firſt in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                  <p>Efficient and finall cauſes bring
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11467:49"/> forth their effects,<note place="margin">Cauſes of themſelues, or by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> either of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and of their owne nature; or by accident. Thus the Sunne <hi>giueth light</hi> of it ſelfe, and of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but by accident <hi>it blindeth Owles.</hi> And <hi>the neighing of Darius his horſe</hi> was the accidentall cauſe of his raiſe to the kingdome. And <hi>thirſt</hi> may be an accidentall cauſe to ſaue a man out of the battaile; if being thirſtie and gone out of the armie to drinke, it ſo happened that whileſt he was a drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the armie was ſuddenly diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited. So a Muſician that buildeth a houſe, is not the cauſe of the building as he is a Muſician, but as he is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect or builder. It is the ſame of the finall cauſe. For example, <hi>healing</hi> is the proper end of Phyſick, but <hi>the gaine</hi> of the Phyſician is an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall end: the one is the end of the Art, and the other of the perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cauſes next or remote.</note>Againe, there be ſome next, and ſome remote cauſes. For example, the next end of the art of a ſouldier is <hi>warre,</hi> and the remote is <hi>victory,</hi> and the end more remote is <hi>a happie peace.</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:11467:49"/> So the next efficient cauſe of death is <hi>ſicknes,</hi> of ſicknes <hi>exceſſe,</hi> and of exceſſe <hi>bad company.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid of formes and matters. The next matter of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is <hi>the wood,</hi> but the remote matter are <hi>the foure Elements.</hi> The next forme of any thing is that which wee call <hi>Specificall;</hi> but the remote formes are thoſe of the next or of the remote <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> So the next forme of a man is <hi>to be reaſonable,</hi> but <hi>to haue ſenſe</hi> is the forme of a liuing creature, which is the Genus of man, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent alſo is the forme of man, but remote.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, there be cauſes,<note place="margin">Cauſes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, or not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</note> which are Sufficient of themſelues to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an effect. As, <hi>the Sunne</hi> is of it ſelfe ſufficient <hi>to giue light,</hi> and <hi>fire to burne,</hi> and <hi>the favour of God to make a man happie.</hi> But there are ſome cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which are not of themſelues Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, &amp; muſt haue many together. As, <hi>to make a fertile</hi> ſoile, the ground muſt be luſtie, it muſt be well tilled, raine muſt moiſten it, and the Sunne
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11467:50"/> muſt heat it in due ſeaſon, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately. <hi>To attaine vnto learning,</hi> a man muſt haue a good wit, good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and be diligent and painefull. So divers things are the cauſes <hi>of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> experience in the Generall, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the Souldiers, military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, neceſſary weapons, &amp;c. but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Now to argue from the cauſes and effects, theſe Maximes<note place="margin">Maximes.</note> are of vſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That which agreeth with the matter, agreeth alſo probably with the thing compoſed of that matter.</hi> As, the earth is heavie, and therefore terreſtriall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are heavie.

                  <p>ETymologie is the derivation of a word.</p>
                  <p>Etymologie in regard of the word, is as a Definition in regard of the thing; and ſerveth to argue and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. As when we ſay, <hi>Such a one is not a Counſellour,</hi> becauſe <hi>he giues no Counſell.</hi> And <hi>Philip cannot be called a Philoſopher,</hi> becauſe <hi>he loues not wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus by the Etymologie of theſe names <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wee gather what our Saviours calling and office is. And wee encourage ſuch as haue a name importing ſome vertue, in ſtirring them vp to vertue by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymologie of their names. So <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> may be exhorted <hi>to Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and <hi>Andrew to valour,</hi> and <hi>Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus to giue himſelfe to heavenly things,</hi> leaſt they belie their names by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary converſation.

As, when <hi>a dwarfe</hi> is called <hi>a Goliah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Good Etymologies in the Engliſh tongue, are for the moſt part taken from the Latin; but ſuch as are drawne from the Engliſh tongue are commonly abſurd and ridiculous. For example, if a man ſhould ſay, that <hi>the woman is the woe of the man; and beere, quaſi, be heere.</hi>

                  <p>The analogie is knowne by the end and vſe. As <hi>the Shepheard in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his flocke,</hi> and <hi>the Paſtor in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Church,</hi> are things Alike.</p>
                  <p>There be certain things differing, which the vulgar take for the ſame things, and none but Philoſophers doe diſtinguiſh them. As, loue and friendſhip; continencie and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; the flatterer and the man-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; memory and remembrance; chance and fortune; hate and envie; whoſe differences are learned by the Ethicks and Phyſicks.</p>
                  <p>Similitudes are rather ornaments of a ſpeech, then any proofes. As, when we ſay, Even as cracks in a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell are knowne when the veſſell is

                  <head>The foureteenth Chapter. <hi>Of things Oppoſit.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OPpoſites are ſuch as cannot ſtand together in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, at the ſame time, and in the ſame regard. As a man cannot be at the ſelfe ſame time <hi>both white</hi> and <hi>blacke</hi> in the ſame part of his bodie, and not compared to other things: though he may be blacke and white, in divers parts of his bodie, either at divers times, or comparatiuely, white in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a Moore, and blacke in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a Swan.</p>
                  <p>There are foure ſorts of Oppoſits. 1. Relatiues. 2. Contraries. 3. Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. 4. Contradictories.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of Relatiues<note place="margin">Relatiues.</note> wee haue alreadie ſpoken. lib. 1. cap. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Contraries<note place="margin">Contraries.</note> are two qualities or two actions which being vnder the ſelfe ſame Genus, are moſt remote one from the other, and are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible. As <hi>blacke</hi> and <hi>white</hi> haue the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:11467:56"/> ſame Genus, namely, <hi>colour: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue</hi> and <hi>vice</hi> are ſpecieſes of <hi>habits,</hi> which being vnder the ſame Genus are of a contrarie nature.</p>
                  <p>Contraries are either Mediate or Immediate. Thus, there is a middle between black and white, namely, <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>browne:</hi> and between hot and cold there is <hi>lukewarme.</hi> But between the number <hi>even</hi> and <hi>odd,</hi> between <hi>the ſtraight</hi> and <hi>crooked line,</hi> there is no third. The middle or meane doth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually participate of the two contrary extreames: the meane between good and bad actions excepted. For the meane is that which is called an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different action,</hi> participating neither of good nor evill.</p>
                  <p>Between two contrary vices, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is the meane. As between <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe</hi> and <hi>prodigalitie,</hi> there is <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, and good husbandrie:</hi> between <hi>raſhneſſe</hi> and <hi>cowardneſſe,</hi> there is <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This mediocritie or meane partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of two extreames, is not in the vertue it ſelfe; for that hath no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11467:56"/> with vice; but it is in thoſe actions and things about which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is occupied. As, <hi>to avoid danger,</hi> and <hi>to lay out money.</hi> For theſe actions partly imitate the covetous man, and partly the liberall. And it fals out of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes that to each of the extreames there is a contrary vertue: as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, good husbandry; to <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, liberalitie:</hi> ſo <hi>cowardneſſe</hi> and <hi>raſhneſſe</hi> are two extreames; and to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, valour</hi> is contrary; and to <hi>raſhneſſe, diſcretion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If two contraries happen to be vnder two next differing Genuſes, (as, <hi>iuſtice</hi> vnder <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>iniuſtice</hi> vnder <hi>vice</hi>) theſe two Genuſes muſt needs be contraries one to another, and Species of the ſame Genus. By this meanes all contraries, if they be not vnder the ſame next Genus, they are vnder the ſame remote Genus.</p>
                  <p>Words are ſometimes wanting to expreſſe one of the contraries. Thus we haue no word to expreſſe the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit contrarie to <hi>an ague,</hi> nor to <hi>a rheume,</hi> nor to <hi>the Phyſicks,</hi> nor to <hi>Grammar.</hi>

                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:11467:57"/>3. Privatiue<note place="margin">Privatiues.</note> oppoſits are a qualitie, and the abſence and privation of that qualitie. As, <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkenes; ſight</hi> and <hi>blindneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There can be no privation, when the ſubiect is not capable of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualitie. Thus in <hi>a ſtone</hi> there is no blindneſſe, becauſe it is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſight. And <hi>a childe in the wombe</hi> cannot be ſaid to be blind, nor <hi>a whelp before it be nine daies old,</hi> becauſe they are not come to that time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhould ſee.</p>
                  <p>The privation of Actions may be remedied and recovered. As the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>the act of ſeeing</hi> is recovered, when he that ſleepeth openeth his eyes to ſee. But the privation of the <hi>Facultie of ſeeing</hi> is irrecoverable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> ſimple and childiſh or brutiſh, are oppoſits pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatiuely. But <hi>wilfull ignorance</hi> that armes it ſelfe with reaſons againſt the truth, is oppoſed vnto knowledge as a contrary, and not as a privation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Contradictories<note place="margin">Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories.</note> are ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene which there is no meane or

                  <p>Now when we will argue and proue any thing, Oppoſits are of great vſe. The Maximes<note place="margin">Maximes.</note> are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whoſoever grants one of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, doth neceſſarily grant the other.</hi> As he that calleth ſuch a one <hi>a father,</hi> affirmeth that he hath <hi>a childe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>One and the ſame thing may be two relatiues;</hi> As, to be <hi>a father</hi> and <hi>ſonne, maſter</hi> and <hi>ſervant, right</hi> and <hi>left:</hi> but in divers reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Contrary things haue a contrary conſequence.</hi> As, vice makes a man wretched, therefore vertue maketh him happie. Here are excepted ſuch things as doe belong to the Genus of the two contraries. For if <hi>blackneſſe</hi> be viſible, it followeth not that <hi>white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> be inviſible; becauſe to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, belongeth to the Genus of whiteneſſe and blackeneſſe, namely, to colour. We muſt alſo except ſuch cauſes as doe act by accident. As, if <hi>a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11467:58"/> white man</hi> buildeth his owne houſe; it followeth not, that <hi>a black man</hi> muſt pull downe his; and if <hi>heat</hi> doth har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the ground, it followeth not that <hi>froſt</hi> muſt ſoften it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſelfe ſame cauſe may bring forth certaine effects, when the action of the cauſe dependeth from the diſpoſition of the matter againſt which it acteth.</hi> So the <hi>Sunne</hi> giues a ſweet ſmell to flowers, but it makes a carrion ſtinke: and <hi>fire</hi> hardens the earth, and ſoftens waxe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Every ſubiect that is capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the one of the contraries, is alſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receiue the other.</hi> Thus, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be heated, may be coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and whatſoever may be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may be ſoftned.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>One of the contraries being granted, the other is overthrowne.</hi> Thus, he that is not <hi>free</hi> is <hi>a bondman.</hi> But <hi>it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that if one of the contraries be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, the other muſt be granted; except they be ſuch contraries, as haue no meane between them.</hi> As, if the bodie be not white, it followeth not that it is black.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11467:58"/> But in contraries that are without meane, this conſequent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Of two good things whereof the one is leſſer and the other greater, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the greateſt good is the greater evill.</hi> As, vertue and health be two good things; if vertue therefore be a greater good then health, vice muſt be a greater evill then ſickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Except</hi> when one of the two good things is compriſed in the other. As, to haue the skill of reading, and the skill of Philoſophie. For though the skill of Philoſophy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Contradictories cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one of them muſt of neceſſity be.</hi> As, there is nothing that is not either man or not man; and it is impoſſible to be both the one and the other, at the ſame time.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whatſoever is deſired in regard of it ſelfe, is better then that which is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely in regard of ſome other thing.</hi> As, <hi>life</hi> is better then <hi>money,</hi> and <hi>ſight</hi> is more to be deſired then <hi>ſpectacles,</hi> and <hi>health</hi> then <hi>Phyſick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That which is good to all, is better then that which is onely good to ſome, and which is vſed but ſeldome, and for certaine reſpects.</hi> Thus <hi>light</hi> is better then <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> and <hi>to haue two armes</hi> is better then <hi>to be maimed.</hi> For dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is of vſe onely for theeues, and debauched perſons; and to haue but one arme is of vſe onely to beggars, who thereby ſet forth their miſery.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That which is good of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is better then that which is good
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11467:59"/> onely by accident, or which is of vſe onely to avoyd a greater evill.</hi> Thus, <hi>health</hi> is better then <hi>Phyſick;</hi> and <hi>to haue our wares in our ſhip,</hi> is better then <hi>to caſt them into the Sea;</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>chance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>One good which when we haue, wee need not the other, is better then that, which when we haue, we haue yet need of the other.</hi> Thus to be loved of <hi>God,</hi> is better then to be loved of <hi>men;</hi> and to haue the perfect knowledge of an Art, is better then to haue it written in a booke.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Of finall cauſes, the laſt is ever the beſt.</hi> Thus happineſſe is better then vertue, and the skill of managing a horſe, is better then the skill to make a ſpurre.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes.</note> 
                     <hi>That which is ſuch of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11467:60"/> is more ſuch then that which is onely ſuch by participation.</hi> Thus the Sunne is cleerer then a looking glaſſe, when the Sunne ſhineth on it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That which is ſuch of it ſelfe, is more ſuch then that which is ſuch onely by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</hi> As, exerciſe and good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is more healthfull, then the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of an arme: and the death of the Sonne of God hath beene more beneficiall to ſalvation, then the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Iudas,</hi> howſoever God vſed it as a meanes for our good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That which is moſt remote from his contrary, is more ſuch then that which is leſſe remote.</hi> And therefore the cold in <hi>Norway</hi> is greater then that in <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe it is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the South, from whence the heat commeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That which acteth more forcibly, is commonly more ſuch, then that which acteth more weakely.</hi> As, that which hurteth more is worſe then that, which hurteth leſſe, and that which pricketh more is ſharper pointed, then that which pricketh leſſe. This

                  <p>THings are compared in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, when we queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two is the more credible. And this is done, when to proue ſome one thing, wee bring in another e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, or more, or leſſe probable, then that which is in queſtion.</p>

                  <p>Firſt when we will proue a thing in queſtion, we may bring in another thing as probable as it. For example, if a Prince hath granted ſomething to one Citizen, another Citizen may
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11467:61"/> pretend, that the like grant ought to be made vnto him alſo; becauſe he is a Citizen as well as the other, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to him. So a fault which is pardoned to ſome one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his youth, muſt be pardoned to another as young as he.

If that which is more probable is not, much leſſe ſhall that be, which is leſſe probable. For example, if a Father will not haue his children goe richly apparelled, much leſſe will he ſuffer it in his ſervants. And if the Apoſtles were not without ſinne, how much leſſe are wee; This is called arguing from a more probable to a leſſe, and grounded vpon this Maxime.<note place="margin">Maxime.</note>

                  <p>The concluſion of ſuch arguments muſt alwayes be negatiue.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">3. Leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</note> we may proue a thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, by bringing in another thing that is leſſe probable, ſaying thus: If a thing leſſe probable, and harder to be beleeved, is notwithſtanding, or hath beene; much more ought we to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that which is more probable and eaſier to be done. So if one at twelue yeares of age can carry a waight of a hundred pound; by a ſtronger reaſon one may carry the ſame weight at the age of twentie yeares. And if <hi>Alexander</hi> tooke <hi>Tyre,</hi> much more eaſily might he haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which was weaker then <hi>Tyre,</hi> if he had beſieged it. This is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led arguing from the leſſe probable to the greater, grounded vpon this Maxime.<note place="margin">Maxime.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>If that which is leſſe probable and leſſe poſſible may be, much more ſhall that be, which is more probable and more poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> The concluſion of ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt alwaies be affirmatiue.</p>

                  <p>Teſtimonies are of force and doe perſwade, when they be ſuch as may not be denied, by reaſon of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, authoritie, ſufficiencie, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of perſons.</p>
                  <p>Teſtimonies are either divine or humane.</p>
                  <p>Divine teſtimonies are Oracles, and all that is called the Word of GOD:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11467:62"/> likewiſe dreames, viſions, miracles, be they true or falſe, if they be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as true. Alſo rules to liue well, derived from nature.</p>
                  <p>Humane teſtimonies, if the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be about matter of right, are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes, cuſtomes, the teſtimonies of Anceſtours, or ſuch as are skilfull in their owne art, the conſent of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But if the queſtion be of fact, then are to be produced ſchedules, acquittances, confeſſions, eye or eare witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such witneſſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Maxime.</note> 
                     <hi>as doe not affirme or denie a thing to be or not to be, are of no force.</hi> For there is a great difference between theſe two ſayings; <hi>God ſaith not that ſuch a thing is,</hi> and <hi>God ſaith that ſuch a thing is not.</hi> The latter is a good proofe, but the former hath no conſequence or ſequel. And likewiſe this proofe is of no effect: <hi>Ariſtotle hath not ſaid ſo, therefore it is not ſo.</hi> Or, <hi>the Word of God ſaith not that man is a reaſonable creature,</hi> and therefore <hi>man is not a reaſonable creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, <hi>if it be a thing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11467:63"/> which cannot be knowne, but by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of one alone, then this kinde of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is good and firme.</hi> Such a one ſaid not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o, and therefore you cannot maintaine that it is ſo. For example, if we had no knowledge of <hi>China</hi> but by the report of one man onely; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever would affirme any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the warrant of ſuch a one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion would be prooved a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar; or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he ſpake the truth it were but by chance, and not knowing himſelfe whether he ſpake true or no. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeeing that nothing that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation can be knowne without warrant from the Word of God; whoſoever in things neceſſarie to ſalvation, affirmeth any thing not contained in the ſaid word of GOD, ought not to be beleeved, &amp; affirmes that which he knowes not.</p>

                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:11467:71"/> which is a Grecke word ſignifying the making vp of an account, or the collecting of a ſumme. For that which is the making vp of an account, or the totall ſumme of Additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication in Arithmetick, the ſame is the concluſion in a Syllogiſme, namely, that which reſulteth and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth from the proofe.</p>
                  <p>Every Syllogiſme is compoſed of two Propoſitions or Enuntiations, and of a Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Enuntiation is a ſpeech, wherein ſomething is affirmed or denied.</p>
                  <p>Every Enuntiation conſiſts of two words at the leaſt, which the Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans call Termes: as, who would ſay, the two ends, or the two peeces. For example.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>The fire burneth.</p>
                     <p>God is good.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Theſe Enuntiations are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of two parts, the one is called the Subject; the other, the Attribute. <hi>Fire</hi> is the Subject; and <hi>burneth</hi> is the Attribute; For burning is attributed to fire. <hi>God</hi> is the Subject; and this word <hi>good</hi> is the Attribute.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:11467:71"/>
                  <p>This Verb, <hi>Is,</hi> is not reckoned as a part of the Enuntiation, but is onely the linke and bond of theſe two parts.</p>
                  <p>Whereſoever there is an affirmation or negation, there is an Enuntiation, though it ſeemeth to be but one word. As when we ſay in Latin, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> we vnderſtand, <hi>ego curro, I runne.</hi> And in Engliſh, <hi>It raineth,</hi> is an vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and common word, which is as much as this Enuntiation, <hi>the raine falleth.</hi> So when we ſay, <hi>It freezeth, It ſnoweth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And when wee aske any body, <hi>Sleepe you?</hi> He that anſwereth <hi>No,</hi> maketh a kinde of ſecret Enuntiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it is as much as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I ſleepe not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we argue, the Enuntiations muſt be full and perfect, ſo as there may be no need of any ſupplying.</p>
                  <p>All truth and falſhood is expreſſed by the Indicatiue mood; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Enuntiation muſt be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Indicatiue; becauſe wee affirme or deny a thing onely by that

                  <p>Enuntiations which haue no note whereby they may be diſcerned to be vniverſals or particulars, are called Indefinites, and in ſtrict dealing muſt be taken for particulars. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, when the matter is Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, they are of as much force as vniverſals.

                  <p>But if the matter be contingent and and mutable: as,
<q>Man is white,</q> they are but as particulars, and is no more then if I ſhould ſay,
<q>Some man is white.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, Enuntiations are either Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue or Negatiue: Affirmatiue; as, <hi>God is good.</hi> Negatiue; as, <hi>God is no lyar.</hi>

                  <p>The vniverſalitie or particularitie of an Enuntiation is called the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie thereof. But to be Affirmatiue or Negatiue maketh the qualitie.</p>
                  <p>Simple Enuntiations are ſometimes modified by certaine circumferences of Neceſſitie, or Contingency, or Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie, or Impoſſibilitie; as,

                     <hi>The third Chapter.</hi> Of the Oppoſition of Enuntiations.</head>
                  <p>OF Enuntiations ſome are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and ſome probable or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent. According to this difference Enuntiations are more or leſſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit one to another. Neceſſarie Enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations are either when the Genus is attributed to the Species; as, <hi>Man is a liuing creature.</hi> Or the difference;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11467:75"/> as, <hi>Man is reaſonable.</hi> Or the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; as, <hi>All fire is hot.</hi> The Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents are when ſome accident is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Subject; as, <hi>The horſe is white. Man is a Phyſician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Oppoſition of Enuntiations is done three manner of wayes. Either as Contraries, or Subcontraries, or Contradictories. In all which Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions one of the two oppoſed Enuntiations muſt ever be affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and the other Negatiue, and the ſame termes muſt ſtill be kept.</p>
                  <p>Contrary Enuntiations are an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall affirmatiue, and an vniverſall negatiue; as,
<q>
                        <p>All men are iuſt.</p>
                        <p>No man is iuſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which are both falſe, becauſe the matter is Contingent. But if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be Neceſſary, then the one is true, and the other falſe; as,
<q>
                        <p>All men are liuing creatures.</p>
                        <p>No man is a liuing creature.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Subcontrarie Enuntiations are two particulars contained vnder two vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals, whereof the one affirmeth,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:11467:75"/> and the other denieth; as,
<q>
                        <p>Some man is iuſt,</p>
                        <p>Some man is not iuſt.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a neceſſary matter the one is true, and the other falſe. But in a contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent matter they may both be true.</p>
                  <p>Contradictory Enuntiations are an vniverſall affirmatiue, and a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar negatiue. Or els an vniverſall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, and a particular affirmatiue; as,
<q>
                        <p>All men are white.</p>

                  <p>And therefore of neceſſitie the one muſt be true, and the other falſe.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>The fourth Chapter.</hi> Of the Converſion of Enuntiations.</head>
                  <p>TO Convert an Enuntiation, is to change it ſo as that the ſubject is turned into the attribute, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute into the ſubject, keeping ſtill the truth. As, <hi>No man is a horſe.</hi> Then if you will convert this Enuntiation, you muſt ſay, <hi>No horſe is a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Converſion is done either Simply, or by Accident.</p>
                  <p>The Simple Converſion is, when the Enuntiation is changed without altering the quantitie. Thus are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall negatiues converted; as in the example before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>And ſo are particular affirmatiues.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:11467:77"/> As, <hi>Some man is learned,</hi> and, <hi>Some learned is a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But vniverſall affirmatiues cannot be converted Simply. For in turning them ſo, their truth would be loſt. Thus it is true, that, <hi>Every man is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature:</hi> but it is not true, that, <hi>Every liuing creature is a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore when wee goe about to convert ſuch Propoſitions, wee take away their vniverſall quantitie, and in ſtead of ſaying <hi>Every man is a living creature,</hi> we turne it into a particular Enuntiation, &amp; ſay, <hi>Some living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a man.</hi> Except when the ſubject is the ſpecies, &amp; the attribute the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For in this caſe the propoſition may bee converted ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. For example, <hi>All living creatures haue ſenſe;</hi> and, <hi>All, that hath ſenſe is a living creature. All bodies haue three dimenſions: All that hath three dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is a bodie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Particular negatiues are not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for example, this Enuntiation, <hi>Some man is not a Philoſopher,</hi> is true. But if you would turne it, it would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:11467:77"/> proue falſe: <hi>Some Philoſopher is not a man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vniverſall affirmatiues may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into vniverſall negatiues, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two negations. As,
<q>
                        <p>All men are living creatures.</p>
                        <p>Whatſoever is not a living creature is no man.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſingular affirmatiue may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a particular affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. As, <hi>This horſe is lame: Some lame thing is a horſe.</hi>

                  <p>A Syllogiſme is thus made. A que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or probleme is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: For example, let the queſtion be, <hi>Whether Philip be a living creature or no?</hi> Now he that will proue by a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme that <hi>Philip</hi> is a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt diſmember the ſaid queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into two parts; the one whereof is the ſubject, namely, <hi>Philip;</hi> and the other the attribute, namely, <hi>living creature.</hi> Then hee muſt looke out ſome third thing, which may be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fitted to each of theſe two parts.

                        </gap>ving creature;</hi> and then he muſt joyne it with <hi>Philip,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Philip is a man;</hi> thence will follow this Concluſion, Therefore <hi>Philip is a living creature.</hi>

                  <p>If the Ring A be joyned with the Ring B and the Ring B with the Ring C, it followeth that the Ring A is joyned with the Ring C.</p>
                  <p>This may alſo be illuſtrated by an example drawne from Numbers, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning thus. Twelue containeth ſix, and ſix containeth three, therefore twelue containeth three. For we ſaid before, that that which is ſaid <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> in Mathematicks, the ſame is ſaid <hi>to be attributed</hi> in Logick.</p>
                  <p>Therefore every Syllogiſme is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of three parts or Termes, namely, the Subject of the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Attribute of the concluſion,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11467:80"/> and the Meane or middle Terme, which knitteth theſe two parts of the concluſion together.</p>
                  <p>It is no hard matter ſo ſoone as a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme is propounded, preſently to perceiue which is the Middle terme. For it is all that which is not in the concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The Meane or middle terme joyned with the attribute of the concluſion, maketh that propoſition which is called the Major or Greater: becauſe the attribute of the concluſion which is called the greater terme is there.

                  <p>THis ſtructure of a Syllogiſme is grounded vpon two naturall Maximes, acknowledged to be true by thoſe of the Meaneſt capacitie. Whereof the firſt is. <hi>Whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth any thing, containeth alſo that which is contained in that thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Maxime conceived in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall termes, is thus to be expreſſed. <hi>Whatſoever is generally attributed to any thing, muſt alſo be attributed to ſuch things, as the ſaid thing is attributed vnto.</hi> As, ſeeing that <hi>to be a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is attributed to <hi>all men,</hi> it muſt alſo be attributed <hi>to Philip,</hi> becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> is a man. This firſt Maxime is the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all Syllogiſmes that conclude affirmatiuely.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Maxime is, <hi>That which agreeth not to a thing and cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto it, agreeth not likewiſe to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11467:81"/> thoſe things which are contained vnder that ſaid thing.</hi> As, <hi>to be Almightie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to <hi>any creature;</hi> therefore it belongeth not <hi>to Angels,</hi> becauſe they are creatures. This Maxime is the ground of all Negatiue Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes, that is to ſay, ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude negatiuely.</p>

                  <p>BEcauſe the Meane is diverſly joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the two termes of the concluſion: hence it comes to paſſe that according to the divers placing of the ſaid Meane, ſundry Figures and Formes of Syllogiſmes doe ariſe. Now theſe Figures are three.</p>
                  <p>The firſt figure is that wherein the <hi>meane</hi> is the ſubject in the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the attribute in the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As, in the examples before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and alſo in this,

                  <p>The ſecond figure is when the Meane is the attribute both in the propoſition and in the aſſumption. As,

                        <hi>A Syllogiſme muſt haue three Termes,</hi> namely, the Subject, and Attribute of the concluſion, and the Meane; for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:11467:82"/> where there be two Meanes the Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme is ſtarke naught. The reaſon drawne from nature is this: If two rings be linked with two other ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rings, it followeth not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe two former rings be linked together. And likewiſe if you would know whether two peeces of ground agree in quantitie, you muſt not take two ſundry meaſures; but onely one and the ſame.

                     <p>We vſe to ſay there be foure termes, not onely when wee finde in a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme foure differing termes in words; but alſo when one and the ſame word is taken in a double ſenſe, and is equivocall; as,

                           <p>Every <hi>NVMBER</hi> is an Accident.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Hence nothing is concluded. This may be known by the ſecond funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall reaſon or Maxime, ſet downe in the third Chapter. And the reaſon is manifeſt: For concluſions are then Negatiue, when the Meane agreeth with one of the termes of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:11467:83"/> and not with the other: whence it is inferred, that the termes of the concluſion agree not together. And therfore the Meane muſt needs agree with one of the two termes; and this is expreſſed by affirmation.</p>
                     <p>Yet here is an exception, namely, when the propoſition hath two ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations equivalent to an affirmation. For example,
<q>
                           <p>Whatſoever is not a living creature is not a man.</p>
                           <p>A Statua is not a liuing creature.</p>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Syllogiſme is good, for the propoſition having two negations, importeth as much as this affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: <hi>Every man is a living creature.</hi>

This rule is grounded vpon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Maxime ſet downe in the third Chapter which ſaith, that in Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes concluding negatiuely, one of the propoſitions muſt be affirmatiue. Except when the negation doe make a part of the Meane. As if I ſay,
<q>
                        <p>All that is not right is crooked.</p>
                        <p>This line is not right.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore</hi> this line is crooked.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The evidence of this will appeare, if you frame the aſſumption thus,
<q>This line is a line which is not right.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For then the aſſumption is turned into an affirmatiue.</p>
                  <p>The preeminences &amp; prerogatiues
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11467:86"/> of the firſt figure are great aboue the two others. For the ſecond figure cannot conclude affirmatiuely, and the third figure cannot conclude vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, but in the firſt figure we may conclude all manner of wayes, and proue all manner of queſtions: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vniverſall affirmatiues, or vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall negatiues, or particular affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, or particular negatiues.</p>
                  <p>Vniverſall affirmatiues. As we may proue that all covetous perſons are theeues, becauſe they withhold other mens goods.</p>
                  <p>Againe vniverſall negatiues. As we may proue that no covetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is free, becauſe he is a ſlaue to his money.</p>
                  <p>Wee may alſo proue in the firſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure a particular affirmatiue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As we may proue that ſome fiſhes haue lungs, becauſe they breath.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we may proue in the firſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure a queſtion that is particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue. As, that <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> are not ſaved, becauſe they were impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:11467:86"/>
                  <p>Moreover, the excellencie of the firſt figure appeares in this, that the others are reduced vnto it. For by changing ſomething in them, they are reduced to the firſt figure; as wee ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Rules for the ſecond Figure.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Figure the Meane is the attribute in both the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt propoſition in this figure muſt be vniverſall,</hi> or els nothing can be concluded. As,
<q>
                        <p>Some living creatures haue two feet.</p>
                        <p>No horſe hath two feet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore</hi> ſome horſe is not a living creature.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The concluſion is falſe, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not; becauſe the propoſition is particular.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>in the ſecond Figure one of the propoſitions muſt be negatiue, and conſequently the concluſion.</hi> For this reaſon were not good to ſay,
<q>
                        <p>All henns haue two feet.</p>
                        <p>You haue two feet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore</hi> you are a henne.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:11467:87"/>
                  <p>The naturall reaſon hereof is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. For it followeth not, that if one thing be attributed to two other things, that theſe two things ſhould be the ſame thing. As, if to be <hi>yellow</hi> belongs both to <hi>hony</hi> and to <hi>gall,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not therefore <hi>that hony is gall:</hi> but it followeth well in the negatiue. As,
<q>
                        <p>Hony is ſweet.</p>
                        <p>Gall is not ſweet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore</hi> gall is not hony.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The naturall reaſon heereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if one thing belongeth to one of the two termes of the queſtion, and not to the other, it followeth that the two termes agree not together.</p>

                     <p>No terreſtriall body mooues vpward.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore</hi> ſmoake is no terreſtriall body.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>You may convert this propoſition,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11467:87"/> ſaying thus,
<q>Nothing that mooues vpward is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo you ſhall haue it in the firſt figure.</p>
                  <p>But if the aſſumption be negatiue, you muſt put it in the place of the propoſition, and then convert ſimply the concluſion, as alſo the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is become the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As in this Syllogiſme,
<q>
                        <p>All men are living creatures.</p>
                        <p>No ſtatua is a living creature.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt change the aſſumption, and ſay,
<q>No living creature is a ſtatua.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſet it in the place of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, thus,

                  <p>Rules for the third Figure.</p>
                  <p>In the third figure the Meane is the ſubject in both propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The aſſumption muſt be affirmatiue, as in the firſt figure.</hi>

                     <hi>The concluſion is alwayes particular, and cannot be vniverſall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The naturall reaſon hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if two things are attributed to the ſame thing, it followeth not that theſe two things agree alwaies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but onely it followeth that they agree ſometimes and in certaine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. As, if to be <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>round</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Sunne, it followeth not that whatſoever is round muſt bee bright.

                  <p>The Syllogiſmes of this figure are reduced to the firſt by converting the aſſumption. As,

                        <p>All horſes neigh.</p>

                     </q>
                  </p>

                  <p>This Syllogiſme will be in the firſt figure.</p>
                  <p>But if the propoſition be particular, ac in this Syllogiſme,
<q>
                        <p>Some Apoſtle is damned.</p>
                        <p>All Apoſtles are ſent of God.</p>

                  <p>Science is a certaine knowledge of a thing certaine, whoſe proofe is drawne from the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>To haue the Science of a thing, two certainties are required. The one is, that the thing be certaine of it ſelfe and vnchangeable. The ſecond is, that the perſwaſion which wee haue of it be firme and cleare. If either of theſe two certainties be wanting it is no Science, but opinion. For a man may haue a doubtfull opinion of a thing certaine. As he that doubteth whether there be a God.</p>
                  <p>And on the contrary, a man may haue a firme and ſtedfaſt perſwaſion of that which is vncertaine and falſe. As thoſe that ſuffer death for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a falſe Religion.</p>

                  <p>If a man know certainly a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeth it, or toucheth it, that is neither called Science, nor Faith, nor opinion; but <hi>ſenſe,</hi> which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely things ſingular: but Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is of things vniverſall.</p>

                     <hi>The fourth Chapter.</hi> What the propoſitions of a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue Syllogiſme ought to be.</head>
                  <p>THe Demonſtration muſt conſiſt of neceſſary propoſitions; among which thoſe are the moſt neceſſarie, which are called Immediate.</p>
                  <p>There be two ſorts of immediate propoſitions, that is to ſay, ſuch as are without any middle. For ſome are immediate in regard of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and others are immediate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Immediate propoſitions in regard of the ſubject are when the attribute agreeth next of all and immediately to the ſubject, ſo as a neerer ſubject cannot be given. In ſuch propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the attribute agreeth with the ſubject, becauſe it is ſuch a ſubject. For example, if I ſay that <hi>a horſe hath
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:11467:101"/> ſenſe,</hi> this attribute agrees not next and immediately to a horſe; for there is a neerer ſubject, namely, an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, vnto the which ſenſe belongeth. But if I ſay that <hi>a horſe neigheth,</hi> this agreeth next and immediately to a horſe, as he is a horſe, and not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any other neerer ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Immediate propoſitions in regard of the cauſe are, when an attribute is ſo neerely joyned to the ſubject, as that the cauſe or reaſon cannot bee yeelded why it ſhould be ſo. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, here is a Demonſtration:
<q>
                        <p>Whatſoever hath a ſenſitiue ſoule hath touching.</p>
                        <p>Every animal hath a ſenſitiue ſoule.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore</hi> every animal hath tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Syllogiſme the concluſion is immediate in regard of the ſubject, but not in regard of the cauſe. For in this Syllogiſme the Meane is the cauſe of the concluſion. But the two propoſitions are immediate, both in regard of the cauſe, as alſo of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:11467:102"/> for nothing can be alledged as a cauſe of their truths.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the efficient and finall cauſes are linked together with a long chaine. As,
<q>Vnder the Aequator the aire is very hot, becauſe it is very ſubtill; The aire is very ſubtill, becauſe the Sunne doth rarefie it very much; The Sunne rarefies the aire, becauſe the beames fall in right angles; The beames fall in right angles, becauſe the Sunne is there in the Zenith.</q> Thus it is in the finall cauſe.</p>
                  <q>The Lungs draw in the aire to refreſh the heat of the heart: The heat of the heart is refreſhed to keepe the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature: The Temperature is kept to preſerue life.</q>
                  <p>So many cauſes, ſo many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. But the laſt where alſo the chiefeſt and laſt cauſe ſtands for the Meane, is the nobleſt of all: becauſe it can no further be demonſtrated: and the two propoſitions are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate every manner of way.</p>

                  <p>In theſe demonſtrations the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are not immediate: For the Meane is not the next cauſe of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute.

This kinde of demonſtration ſhewes not why the concluſion is, but onely that it is. As,

                  <p>GEnerally all Syllogiſmes may be faultie, either in the forme, or in the matter. They are faultie in the Forme, when the rules of the figures are not obſerved, committing a fault, either in the quantitie, or qualitie, or the propoſitions, or in the placing of the Meane, or if there be more then three termes.</p>
                  <p>The Syllogiſme is faultie in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:11467:113"/> Matter, when one of the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or both, are falſe, either in the whole, or in part. This faultineſſe happeneth ſometimes through ſimplicitie, and without cunning, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſometimes it is fraudulent and with cunning; ſuch as are the fallacies aboue mentioned. If a Syllogiſme be faulty in the forme, it muſt be brought to the true forme. If it be faultie in the matter, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which is falſe muſt be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And if it be doubtfull or true in part onely, it muſt be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>But if the fault be neither in the forme, nor in the matter, but onely in the fallacie of the ignorance of that which contradicteth the queſtion, by the which the adverſary maintaineth a thing which doth not prejudice the queſtion; in ſuch a caſe wee muſt grant all that the adverſary ſaith, and ſhew him, that in thinking to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict vs, be doth it not.</p>
                  <p>The end and ſcope of theſe fallacies, is not to teach vs how to deceiue, but how to avoide deceipt.</p>
